### Conversion of an audio signal to control a Tesla coil using operational amplifiers

The goal of the project is to design an electronic circuit schematic in the EAGLE software that enables the conversion of an audio signal from a computer into a control signal for a Tesla coil. The project involves selecting appropriate operational amplifiers and other electronic components and integrating them into a schematic capable of processing the audio signal into a signal with the proper amplitude and frequency to control the Tesla coil.
